I hope to create many mini-games that live on SVC website, a chain of mini-games that tell a fresh narrative of the SVC universe starting with a scientist/engineer who makes a breakthrough on faster than light travel, and eventually goes to investigate a long observed signal coming from space. Shortly before FTL is acheived, the signal goes quiet, yet it remains the destination. The story unfolds from there with the Starship Fermi eventually arriving to an empty solar system with strange graviational imbalances that imply a missing planet. This eventually leads to a confronation with the Matrioshka Brain, the Space Queen, and a discovery that the center of the galaxy is a vast and highly populated region of space teeming with alien life. Ultimately the game leads from the intro through an ever-expanding chain of games and mini-games ultimately evolving into a game-dense & life-dense space.
